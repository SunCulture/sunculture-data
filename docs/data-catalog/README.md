3. **Step** : **Running the development server**

   - To preview the changes, run:
     ```sh
        cd <app-name>

     ```
   - By default, a browser window will open at http://localhost:3000.

4. **Step** : **Build**
   - Docusaurus is a modern static website generator so we need to build the website into a directory of static contents and put it on a web server so that it can be viewed. To build the website:
     ```sh
        npm run build
     ```

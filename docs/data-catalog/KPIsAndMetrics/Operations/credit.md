## 📝 Notes

- **FPD**: _First Payment Default_ – Customers who default on their very first payment.
- **PAR30**: _Portfolio At Risk 30_ – Indicates how much of the portfolio is overdue by more than 30 days.
- **CDS1 / CDS2**:
  - **CDS1** is the initial KYC-level survey that captures basic customer and household information.
  - **CDS2** is the detailed survey used to assess credit risk and determine PAYG onboarding eligibility.
- **Collection Rate** typically considers only _active accounts_—those expected to make payments in the period.
- Benchmarks marked _TBD_ are being refined and may vary by market (Kenya, Uganda, Côte d’Ivoire).

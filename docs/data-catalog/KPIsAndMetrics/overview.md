# 📊 KPIs & Metrics Overview

Welcome to the centralized hub for all **Metrics** and **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** at **SunCulture**.

This space serves as a **single source of truth** for how we define, calculate, and track key metrics across teams. Whether you're building dashboards, aligning on targets, or digging into performance trends—this is where shared definitions live.

---

## 📘 Definition of Terms

- **Metric**: A quantifiable measure of business activity (e.g., number of leads, total units sold).
- **KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**: A critical metric that reflects how well a team or function is achieving strategic goals.
- ➕ _All KPIs are metrics, but not all metrics are KPIs._ KPIs are the most impactful, decision-driving metrics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Standardize Business Language**: Establish consistent definitions for KPIs and metrics to ensure aligned performance tracking across teams.
- **Promote Consistency & Transparency**: Eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear reference point for reporting and decision-making.
- **Enable Self-Service Discovery**: Make KPIs and metrics **easy to find, understand, and trust**.
- **Support Scalable Analytics**: Foster a data-informed culture and reduce onboarding friction by documenting critical metrics in one place.

## 📁 What’s Inside

Metrics are organized by **department** and functional domain. Each section provides:

- **Topic** — Thematic focus (e.g., Performance, Productivity)
- **Business Question** — The core question the metric answers
- **KPI / Metric** — Name of the measure
- **Calculation** — How it's computed
- **Benchmark** — Target or goal (if available)
- **Comments** — Notes or interpretation tips

All entries are displayed in a **concise, tabular format** for quick consumption.

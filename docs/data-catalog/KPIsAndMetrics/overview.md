# 📊 KPIs & Metrics Overview

Welcome to the centralized hub for all **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** and **business metrics** at **SunCulture**.

This space provides a **single source of truth** for how we define, calculate, and track key metrics across teams. Whether you’re building dashboards, aligning on targets, or digging into performance trends—this is where shared definitions live.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Promote **consistency and transparency** across teams.
- Provide a **clear reference point** for reporting and decision-making.
- Make KPIs and metrics **easy to find, understand, and trust**.
- Foster a **data-informed culture** through aligned measurement.

## 📁 What’s Inside

KPIs and metrics are organized by **department**. Each section includes a structured view with:

- **Topic** — Thematic area of focus (e.g., Overall Performance, Productivity)
- **Business Question** — The key question the metric answers
- **KPI / Metric** — The name of the metric
- **Calculation** — How the metric is computed
- **Benchmark** — Target or goal (where applicable)
- **Comments** — Additional context or interpretation notes

This layout is designed to be **concise, intuitive, and insightful**, using tables instead of long-form descriptions.

## Definition

**PAR30 (Portfolio At Risk > 30 Days)** is a key credit performance indicator representing the percentage of total receivables that are overdue by more than 30 days.

## Business Logic

PAR30 is used to assess the proportion of receivables that are at significant risk of non-payment. It reflects the quality and health of the PAYG portfolio. A high PAR30 signals potential default risks and may necessitate intervention strategies.

This metric is a snapshot of risk at a point in time and typically excludes fully paid or repossessed accounts.

## Formula

**PAR30 (%) = (Outstanding Balance of Accounts > 30 Days Past Due รท Total Outstanding Portfolio) ร 100**

- **Outstanding Balance of Accounts > 30 Days Past Due**: Total unpaid amount from customers who are more than 30 days late.  
- **Total Outstanding Portfolio**: The sum of all unpaid balances from active PAYG accounts.

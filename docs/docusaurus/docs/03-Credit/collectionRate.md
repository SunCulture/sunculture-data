## Definition

**Collection Rate** is the percentage of expected payments that were actually collected from PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) customers within a specific time period (usually monthly). It measures how effectively the company is recovering dues from active accounts.

## Business Logic

Collection Rate is used to evaluate the health and repayment behavior of the PAYG portfolio. A high collection rate indicates strong customer compliance and financial discipline, while a low rate could point to repayment issues or operational challenges.

This metric typically excludes customers who have fully paid off their loans or whose loans have been repossessed, focusing only on active accounts expected to pay.

## Formula

**Collection Rate (%) = (Total Amount Collected รท Total Amount Due) ร 100**

- **Total Amount Collected**: Sum of payments received from active PAYG customers during the period.  
- **Total Amount Due**: Sum of scheduled payments expected from those same customers during the period.

## 🔍 Definitions

### **Metric**

A **Metric** is a broad, quantifiable measure used to assess performance or activity. It is a raw number or data point that gives insight but does not inherently measure success or failure.

**Examples:**

- **Sales**: Number of units sold
- **Finance**: Total expenses

---

### **KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**

A **KPI** is a specific type of metric directly tied to a strategic business objective. KPIs help evaluate whether a team or initiative is meeting its targets.

**Examples:**

- **Sales**: Sales Growth (%), tied to monthly/quarterly targets
- **Marketing**: Lead Conversion Rate
- **Credit**: PAR30 (Portfolio At Risk > 30 days)

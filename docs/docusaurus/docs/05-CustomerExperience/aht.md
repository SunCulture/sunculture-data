## Definition

**Average Call Handling Time (AHT)** is a key performance indicator that measures the average amount of time an agent spends on a call with a customer, including both talk time and any follow-up work related to that call.

## Business Logic

AHT is used to evaluate the efficiency of a call center and the effectiveness of customer service agents. A lower AHT is generally desired, as it indicates that agents are handling calls more efficiently. However, it's important to balance AHT with the quality of service. Reducing AHT too much can lead to customer dissatisfaction if issues are not resolved properly.

AHT is often used alongside other metrics like Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and First Call Resolution (FCR) to gauge the overall performance of a call center.

## Formula

- **Total Talk Time**: The total time agents spend speaking with customers during calls.
- **Total Hold Time**: The total time customers spend on hold during calls.
- **Total After Call Work Time (ACW)**: The time spent by agents on activities related to the call after it ends, such as updating records or resolving issues.

## Definition

**Call Center Efficiency (CCE)** is a KPI that measures how effectively a call center uses its available time to engage with customers. It helps in evaluating the overall productivity of the call center agents.

## Business Logic

CCE is used to assess how efficiently call center agents are utilizing their available work time. A higher CCE indicates that agents are spending more time on customer-related activities such as handling calls and less time in idle or unproductive activities. It's an important metric for managing workforce performance and improving operational efficiency.

While a higher CCE is generally a good indicator of efficiency, it is important to monitor this metric alongside other factors like call quality and customer satisfaction to ensure that increasing efficiency does not negatively impact customer experience.

## Formula

- **Total Talk Time**: The total time agents spend on calls with customers.
- **After Call Work (ACW)**: The time spent by agents on post-call activities such as updating records or resolving issues.
- **Available Time**: The total time that agents are available to take calls (i.e., not on breaks or in idle).

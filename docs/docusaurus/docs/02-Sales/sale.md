## Definition

**Sale** refers to the completion of a transaction in which a customer purchases a product or service. The definition varies based on the payment method:

- **For Cash Clients**: The sale is considered completed on the date the full payment is received.
- **For PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) Clients**: The sale is considered completed when the full deposit is made by the customer.

This KPI helps track the number of sales based on when the transaction is finalized and is an important metric for assessing business revenue generation.

## Business Logic

The sale date is critical for understanding when revenue is realized and for accurate financial reporting. This metric is used to track performance and forecast future sales trends. The differentiation between Cash and PAYG clients is essential, as it affects both the timing of sales and the cash flow into the business.

For **Cash Clients**, the date the payment is made signals that the transaction has been completed, and the revenue can be recognized.

For **PAYG Clients**, while the full payment may be made in installments, the sale is recorded once the full deposit is paid, signaling that the transaction is progressing toward completion.

## Formula

- **Sale Date for Cash Clients**: The date the full payment is received from the customer.
- **Sale Date for PAYG Clients**: The date the full deposit is paid by the customer.

```text
**Sale Date (for Cash Clients) = Date when full payment is received.**

**Sale Date (for PAYG Clients) = Date when full deposit is made.**
